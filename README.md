## Abstract
    Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are critical for identifying malicious activity
    in computer networks; however, the evaluation of machine learning-based IDSs
    remains inconsistent and fragmented. Many existing studies rely on outdated or
    synthetic datasets, neglect computational complexity, or use limited performance
    metrics, making comparison and reproducibility difficult. Moreover, few works
    leverage the full potential of modern GPU acceleration across all stages of IDS
    pipelines.
        This paper presents a large-scale, GPU-accelerated benchmarking framework for
    intrusion detection, integrating automated data preprocessing, dataset complexity
    analysis, and classification evaluation. The pipeline supports entropy-guided
    encoding, multi-objective hyperparameter optimization, and reproducible assessment
    across more than 70 publicly available IDS datasets.
        Our findings show that data- and model-efficient configurations can match the
    predictive performance of full-scale models while significantly reducing training
    time, inference latency, and model size. In some cases, setups even improve
    generalization by removing noise or redundant features. These insights are
    supported by distributional and correlation-based analyses, offering a nuanced
    view of performance-efficiency trade-offs in IDS evaluation.
        All code, configurations, and results are released to support reproducible
    research. This work aims to facilitate future benchmarking efforts and inform the
    design of efficient, generalizable IDS models.
